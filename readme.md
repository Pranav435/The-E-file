Read-me for E-file

E-file, incidentally my cs50 project, is an easy way to encrypt / decrypt / create any file.

1. Encryption
The encryption works pretty easily.
When you first launch the app, which is only for now made for laptops and desktops, you will be in a text menu where you can press e to encrypt, d to decrypt or c to create a file. [note: the capitals of these letters can be used too]
Encryption:\
This app uses the 256 bit encryption algorithm which is the most secure, and sometimes also used in government offices to secure their files.
When you hit e or E, you will first have to enter the absolute path of the decrypted file.
Once done, you will have to enter an encryption key, which will work quite like a password to your data.
Now the encrypted version of the file will be created in the same directory as the decrypted version.

2. Decryption
While decrypting, which is when you hit d or D, you first enter the absolute path of the encrypted file.
Next, you enter your key. Note: This has to be exactly as the same key that you or someone else used for encryption of the same file.
Next, you enter the type of the target file. Supported file types are txt, bgt, py and wav.
And, your decrypted version will now appear in this directory.

3. Conclusion:
I hope you like this small applications, even though it has quite a few bugs.
